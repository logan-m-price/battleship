This is a program for playing Battleship, designed and written by 
Logan Price.

The images and rules.txt file are required for playing this game 
and must be stored in the same folder as the BattleshipGame.exe 
file to  operate correctly. Source code written in Python 3.7 
(BattleshipGame.py and BattleshipGui.py).

I did not make nor claim to have made any of the pictures used 
in this project. I claim fair use on these as they are used in 
the intention of education and are not used for nor result in any 
monetary gain.
